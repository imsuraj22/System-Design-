The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming and design, and it was introduced by Barbara Liskov in 1987. The principle states:

"Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types."

In simpler terms, if a class is a subtype (or subclass) of another class, it should be able to be used in place of its base class without affecting the correctness of the program. This principle helps ensure that inheritance hierarchies are well-structured and maintain the "is-a" relationship between subclasses and their base classes.
